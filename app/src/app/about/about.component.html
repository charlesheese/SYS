  <p class="about-text">
    Welcome to the Northeastern Ticket Resale Hub â€“ a platform created by Northeastern students, for Northeastern students. Founded by Charlie, John, Ripan, and Aryaman, our goal is to make ticket reselling safe, simple, and accessible for the entire Northeastern community.
  </p>
  <p class="about-text">
    As students ourselves, we understand the hassle of finding trustworthy sources for concert, event, and sports tickets, or selling unused tickets without excessive fees or scams. Our platform provides a streamlined marketplace exclusively for Northeastern students.
